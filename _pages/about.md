I'm now a master candidate in Transportation Engineering at Tongji University, supervised by [Prof. Xuesong Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qPNyQCsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). I earned my B.Sc (2022) in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Tongji University. I'm also a Research Assistant in Department of Computer Science at New York University Shanghai, supervised by [Prof. Zhaonan Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fNdU6I0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).

<p style="color: red"> I am currently seeking a suitable PhD position for 2026. If you're interested, please feel free to contact me!</p>

## Research Interest
My research interests span the following areas:

1. **AI/ML for Traffic Prediction**: Applying advanced AI methods for prediction. My previous studies include real-time crash prediction and electric vehicle charging demand prediction using LSTM-based and GNN-based techniques, respectively.
2. **Causal Inference**: My previous work includes designing a semi-data-driven Bayesian network structure learning algorithm and summarizing the five aspects of model interpretability in traffic crash analytics. I am also very familiar with concepts, assumptions, frameworks and methods of causal inference.
3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: The sources of uncertainty can be classified into three categories: data, model, and distribution uncertainty. I'm currently working on this topic.
