I'm now an incoming Research Assistant at New York University Shanghai, supervised by [Prof. Zhaonan Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fNdU6I0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Before that, I got my M.Sc (2025) in Transportation Engineering from Tongji University, supervised by [Prof. Xuesong Wang](https://tjsafety.cn/MembersInformation.aspx?YNID=487&YNID2=334&ID=495). I earned my B.Sc (2022) in Applied Mathematics from Tongji University.

<p style="color: red"> I am currently seeking a suitable PhD position for Spring/Fall 2026. If you're interested, please feel free to contact me! </p>

## Research Interest
My research interests span the following areas:

1. **AI/ML for Traffic Prediction**: Applying advanced AI methods for prediction. My previous studies include real-time crash prediction and electric vehicle charging demand prediction using LSTM-based and GNN-based techniques, respectively.
2. **Causal Inference**: My previous work includes summarizing the five aspects of interpretability in traffic crash analytics and designing a semi-data-driven Bayesian network structure learning algorithm. I have learned the concept and prepared an initial research proposal about causal inference with 16 pages.
3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: The sources of uncertainty can be classified into three categories: data, model, and distribution uncertainty. I'm currently working on this topic.
